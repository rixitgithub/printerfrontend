    {
      question: "What materials can I use for 3D printing?",
      answer: "Common 3D printing materials include PLA, ABS, PETG, TPU, and Nylon. Each has unique properties suitable for different applications. PLA is eco-friendly and easy to print, while ABS is more durable and heat-resistant."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does 3D printing take?",
      answer: "Print time varies based on size, complexity, and quality settings. Small objects might take 1-3 hours, while larger or more detailed prints can take 10+ hours. We provide estimated print times before starting your project."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the cost of 3D printing?",
      answer: "Costs depend on factors like material usage, print time, and complexity. Basic prints typically range from $10-50, while complex or large projects may cost more. Contact us for a detailed quote for your specific project."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer custom designs?",
      answer: "Yes! Our team of designers can help create custom 3D models based on your specifications. We also accept existing 3D models in common formats like STL, OBJ, and STEP."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the maximum print size?",
      answer: "Our standard printers accommodate objects up to 250x250x300mm. For larger projects, we can split models into parts or use our industrial-scale printers that handle up to 500x500x600mm."
